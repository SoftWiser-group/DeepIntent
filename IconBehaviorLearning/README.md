### functional

prepare.py -> prepare texts, split training data, testing data

model.py -> train -> training pkl
model.py -> test -> testing pkl
model.py -> feature -> trained model, target pkl

### prepared data

1. real experimental data (benign, malicious) -> train and test
2. data to test prepare process (results of the previous example)
3. pre-trained model, to get prediction probabilities and features
